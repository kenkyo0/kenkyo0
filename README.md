I’m *nick*.
I like creating and tinkering with every technologie i get in my hands. Right now I'm really into C++ development, secure coding in low level languages and learning nix.
I'm studying digital forensics and CyberSec.

 _At the moment working with:_
  - c
  - cpp
  - lua
  - python
  - nix
  - r
